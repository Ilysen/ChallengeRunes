# Challenge Runes 
Challenge Runes borrows the challenge items from Calamity and separates them into their own mod. These items can be used to increase the challenge of certain parts of the game, while offering increased rewards.

I don't claim originality for the Armageddon and Defiled runes - they are directly referencing Calamity and have very similar effects. I wanted to adapt these ideas into a standalone mod so that they could be used in normal Terraria and other content mods, too.

Armageddon Rune - While a boss is alive, taking any damage will instantly kill you. Upon beating a boss, however, it will drop 5 treasure bags, or 6 in Expert Mode.

Defiled Rune - All damage inflicted by monsters is doubled. Enemies drop twice as much money.

Frozen Rune - You deal half damage with all weapons. Enemies drop 50% more money.

Scorched Rune - All life regeneration is disabled. Enemies drop additional hearts, and bosses drop life crystals and mana crystals. Hardmode bosses drop life fruits (in Hardmode only, of course.)

The Apocalypse Sigil enables all four of these runes at once, and grants normal enemies a 1% chance to drop a Basalt Chunk that sells for 1 gold. Bosses will always drop two chunks on death. In Armageddon, bosses also drop one chunk, regardless of if Apocalypse is active.

All runes and sigils can be crafted at a demon altar for no cost.
